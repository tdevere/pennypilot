# 🔧 Troubleshooting GitHub Actions

## Common GitHub Actions Errors & Solutions

### ❌ **Error: Job depends on unknown job**

```
Job 'build-ios' depends on unknown job 'lint-and-test'
```

**Cause:** Job name mismatch between the job definition and the `needs:` reference.

**Solution:**
```yaml
# ❌ Wrong
jobs:
  test-and-lint:  # Job defined as 'test-and-lint'
    ...
  
  build-ios:
    needs: lint-and-test  # ❌ Referencing wrong name

# ✅ Correct
jobs:
  test-and-lint:  # Job defined as 'test-and-lint'
    ...
  
  build-ios:
    needs: test-and-lint  # ✅ Matches job name
```

---

### ❌ **Error: Circular dependency graph**

```
Job 'notify-on-failure' depends on job 'build-ios' which creates a cycle
```

**Cause:** Jobs depend on each other in a circle (A needs B, B needs A).

**Solution:** Remove circular dependencies
```yaml
# ❌ Wrong - Circular dependency
jobs:
  test:
    ...
  
  build:
    needs: test
  
  notify:
    if: failure()
    needs: [test, build]  # ❌ Creates cycle with 'if: failure()'

# ✅ Correct - Linear dependency
jobs:
  test:
    ...
  
  build:
    needs: test
  
  notify:
    if: ${{ failure() && github.event_name == 'pull_request' }}
    needs: test  # ✅ Only depends on test
```

---

### ❌ **Error: Context access might be invalid**

```
Context access might be invalid: EXPO_TOKEN
```

**Cause:** GitHub secrets not configured in repository settings.

**Solution:**
1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Add `EXPO_TOKEN` with your Expo access token
4. Or use placeholder commands until secrets are configured:

```yaml
# Temporary placeholder until secrets configured
- name: Build iOS app
  run: echo "iOS build would run here with EAS CLI"
  continue-on-error: true
```

## 🔍 How to Debug Workflow Errors

### **1. Check Workflow File Locally**

```bash
# Validate YAML syntax
cat .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml | grep -E "^jobs:|^  [a-z-]+:"

# Check for job name consistency
grep -n "needs:" .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
```

### **2. View Errors on GitHub**

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Actions** tab
3. Look for red X next to workflow run
4. Click on failed workflow
5. Read error messages at the top

### **3. Test Workflow Changes**

```bash
# Make changes to workflow file
nano .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml

# Commit and push
git add .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
git commit -m "fix: resolve workflow errors"
git push origin main

# GitHub will automatically validate and run the workflow
```

## ✅ **Fixed PennyPilot CI/CD Workflow**

### **What Was Fixed:**

1. **Job Name Mismatch**
   - Changed `needs: lint-and-test` → `needs: test-and-lint`
   - Job was defined as `test-and-lint` but referenced as `lint-and-test`

2. **Circular Dependencies**
   - Simplified `notify-on-failure` to only depend on `test-and-lint`
   - Removed dependencies on `build-ios` and `build-android`

3. **Missing EXPO_TOKEN**
   - Changed EAS build commands to echo placeholders
   - Added `continue-on-error: true` for build jobs
   - Can be updated once Expo secrets are configured

### **Current Workflow Structure:**

```
test-and-lint
    ├── build-ios (only on main branch)
    ├── build-android (only on main branch)
    └── notify-on-failure (only on PR failure)
```

---

## 🚀 **Workflow Execution Flow**

### **On Pull Request:**
```
1. test-and-lint runs
   ├─ TypeScript check
   ├─ ESLint
   ├─ Prettier check
   ├─ Jest tests
   └─ Coverage report

2. If tests pass ✅
   → PR can be merged

3. If tests fail ❌
   → notify-on-failure comments on PR
```

### **On Push to Main:**
```
1. test-and-lint runs
   ├─ All checks pass ✅

2. build-ios runs (macOS runner)
   └─ Placeholder for EAS build

3. build-android runs (Ubuntu runner)
   └─ Placeholder for EAS build
```

## 🔐 **Setting Up Expo Secrets (Optional)**

To enable actual builds:

### **1. Get Expo Access Token**
```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli

# Login to Expo
eas login

# Generate access token
eas whoami
# Go to https://expo.dev/accounts/[username]/settings/access-tokens
# Create new token
```

### **2. Add to GitHub Secrets**
1. Go to GitHub repository
2. Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
3. Click "New repository secret"
4. Name: `EXPO_TOKEN`
5. Value: Your Expo access token
6. Click "Add secret"

### **3. Update Workflow**
```yaml
# Change from placeholder:
- name: Build iOS app
  run: echo "iOS build would run here"

# To actual build:
- name: Build iOS app
  run: npx eas-cli build --platform ios --profile preview --non-interactive
  env:
    EXPO_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.EXPO_TOKEN }}
```

## 📋 **Common Workflow Patterns**

### **Sequential Jobs (One After Another)**
```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: npm test

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: test  # Waits for test to complete
    steps:
      - run: npm run deploy
```

### **Parallel Jobs (Run at Same Time)**
```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: npm test

  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: npm run lint

  # test and lint run in parallel (no 'needs')
```

### **Conditional Jobs**
```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: npm test

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: test
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'  # Only on main branch
    steps:
      - run: npm run deploy
```

### **Matrix Strategy (Multiple Versions)**
```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [16, 18, 20]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      - run: npm test
```

## 🛠️ **Testing Workflow Changes Locally**

### **Using Act (GitHub Actions Simulator)**

```bash
# Install act (GitHub Actions local runner)
# Windows (with Chocolatey)
choco install act-cli

# Mac (with Homebrew)
brew install act

# Run workflow locally
act -j test-and-lint

# Run specific event
act pull_request

# Run with secrets
act -s EXPO_TOKEN=your-token-here
```

### **YAML Linting**

```bash
# Install YAML linter
npm install -g yaml-lint

# Validate workflow file
yamllint .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
```

---

## 📊 **Monitoring Workflow Status**

### **GitHub UI**
- Actions tab → See all workflow runs
- Green ✅ = Passed
- Red ❌ = Failed
- Yellow 🟡 = In progress

### **GitHub CLI**
```bash
# View workflow runs
gh run list

# View specific run
gh run view <run-id>

# View logs
gh run view <run-id> --log
```

### **Badges in README**
```markdown
![CI/CD](https://github.com/tdevere/pennypilot/actions/workflows/ci-cd.yml/badge.svg)

## ✅ **Checklist: Workflow File Best Practices**

- [ ] Job names are consistent (definition matches `needs:` references)
- [ ] No circular dependencies between jobs
- [ ] Secrets are properly configured in GitHub settings
- [ ] Use `continue-on-error: true` for non-critical steps
- [ ] Use `if:` conditions to control when jobs run
- [ ] Add descriptive `name:` fields for steps
- [ ] Use caching for dependencies (`cache: 'npm'`)
- [ ] Pin action versions (`@v4` not `@latest`)
- [ ] Test workflows on feature branches before merging
